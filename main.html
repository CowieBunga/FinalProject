                <p>My name is Jackson Cowie, and I'm 5'8''. Despite my height, I still like to have a good time.
                    I'm a grade 11 student at Greenwood College School.</p>
                <p>Some fun facts about me include...</p>
                <p>1.   I was once ranked tenth in Ontario for squash.</p>
                <p>2.   In grade three, I gave a speech about recycling to 700 people</p>
                            <p>3.   I'll be an LIT at Kilcoo Camp this summer</p>
                    <p>My favourite things are golf and The Simpsons. Yes, I know these aren't run-of-the-mill things,
                    but I'm not that kind of guy. I try my best to bring out my odd, yet scientific personality in my
                    website. So if you too like to have a good time, hopefully you'll come along for the ride throughout
                    space with me

                <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
                <p>According to Merriam Webster, AI is &quot;an area of computer science that deals with giving machines
                    the ability to seem like they have human intelligence.&quot; Basically, the programmers (us)
                    try to make a computer smart enough to make decisions and think logically on their own.

                <h1>What is Space Exploration?</h1>
                <p>Space Exploration is the discovery and investigation of celestial structures in outer space, involving technology.
                    Throughout my website, I will talk about how exploration has been made increasingly easier by the development of AI and how the future will be impacted by space and AI.

                <div class="imp-text">
                    <p>According to SingularityHub, AI has made scientific research and space exploration 10 times easier.
                        There are already many AI powered machines in space right now that are helping humans down on earth.

                        ISS on July 2nd 2018. CIMON was programmed to create a feeling of talking to a crew mate as to
                        simulate the most authentic interaction possible.</p>
                        <h1>The Next Step: Mars</h1>
                        <h3>A Brief Overview</h3>
                        <p>Human colonization of Mars is something that is becoming more real everyday.
                            When Earth and Mars are closest, the trip would take 260 days.
                            The Mars 2020 rover is in intense development, and has doubled in productivity because of AI.

                        <div class = "mars-text">
                            <p><h2>1.</h2>Despite AI's productivity factor, there are still many problems with inhabiting
                            Mars. The main problem is that it would get extremely claustrophobic. The atmosphere is too
                            thin, and the planet isn't warm enough to sustain human life. This would mean that people would
                            have to live in environment controlled infrastructure, that should be able to sustainably produce
                            food and water.

                            <p> <h2>2.</h2>If we want to learn more about Mars, the answer is simple: we need to make better
                            AI. The main problem right now is the communication delay. A rover on Mars solely controlled
                            by a team of engineers can only be given instructions to move every 20 minutes.  If we are
                            going far out in space, AI machines need to be smart enough to make decisions on their own.</p>

                            scientists figure out a way to reduce radiation, the future of space exploration would skyrocket

        <p>In 2015, Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and other science and tech leaders signed an open letter saying that
            artificial intelligence technology could generate a global arms race unless the United Nations steps in
            with a ban. Their theory is that if military powerhouses like the US or Russia begin mass production of
            AI weapons, an arms race is inevitable. Clearly, there are concerns being expressed, but
            leading scientists believe AI shouldn't be thought of killing machines, rather a step in the right direction
            towards a more advanced future.

        <p>Just a year ago, Musk noted in a documentary that AI research might create an "immortal dictator from which
            we could never escape". In 2014, Hawking said artificial intelligence might end up annihilating the human race.

    <h1>Will AI Take Over Our Jobs?</h1>
    <p>A survey by Pew Research finds Americans are roughly twice as likely to express worry (72%) than
        enthusiasm (33%) about a future of AI in the workplace. AI can do basic tasks that are monotonous and repetitive,
        while humans work on more advanced tasks. AI can do these jobs more efficiently and effectively as well.
    </p>
    <p>Jobs <b>likely to be taken over:</b> Concierges, Truck Drivers and Retail Managers.</p>
    <p>Jobs <b>unlikely to be taken over:</b> Massage therapists, Animal Scientists, Archaeologists
    </p>
    <p>People need to focus on the bigger picture: how to redesign jobs as a whole and change business processes.
        AI can make the physical workers more productive by letting them focus on the tasks that need more attention.
        Just because some of the activities in a job have been automated, does not imply that the whole job has disappeared.
    </p>
    <div class="SKICAT"></div>
    <div id = "SKICAT-text">
        <p><b>The Sky Image Cataloging and Analysis Tool (SKICAT)</b> has helped astronomers identify objects in space that
        humans wouldn't be able to do otherwise. Similar machines have helped discover new gravitational lenses that
        play a crucial role in connection with dark matter. This type of technology is especially exciting because it
        can also be used to see if a planet's geographical features are suitable for life. AI can make research and celestial identification much easier. It would be obscene
        to make humans do this kind of thing. With AI doing the jobs like this, humans can focus on the exploration side
        of things.
    </p>
    </div>
    <h1>A Personal Opinion</h1>
    <p>With AI taking jobs that are mindless, humans will be able to focus on tasks that nurture innovation, which, in
        turn will benefit society as a whole. AI taking over easy jobs will encourage more people to pursue
        higher education, which leads to a more nourished economy. In the short term, there may be some frictional and
        structural unemployment, but in the long term, AI will help humans flourish, both in space and on land.
